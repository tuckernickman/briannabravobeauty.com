            "Brianna did my makeover for a company holiday party and she did such an amazing job.
            I appreciate how welcoming she was to me as a trans and masculine person getting a makeover.
            She did such a great job matching my skin tone which hasn't always been the case for me as a mixed race 
            person getting makeovers or makeup done. she's a joy to work with and super personable and talented.
            Highly recommend her for photo shoots, special events, and just to feel really good about yourself!"</p>

            through I was SO LATE. 
            You immediately got me talking and helped me feel so comfortable.
            You are a makeup magician and wish I could do makeup like you!!!
