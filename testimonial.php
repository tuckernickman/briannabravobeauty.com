              I appreciate how welcoming she was to me as a trans and masculine person getting a makeover.
              She did such a great job matching my skin tone which hasn't always been the case for me as a mixed race 
              person getting makeovers or makeup done. she's a joy to work with and super personable and talented.
              Highly recommend her for photo shoots, special events, and just to feel really good about yourself!"
