        I estâ€‹ablished my little business in 2018 based on my love for not only makeup, but the way I felt in it.
        I'm a HMUA who specializes in boudoir and bridal.
        I'm all about pushing the world's expectations of us as womxn.
        They expect us to be perfect, perfect body, perfect skin, perfect values.
        If you're a mom, you have to be a good mom, but be hot. Be natural, but your natural needs to be flawless.
        Honey, believe me when I tell you... you are worth so much more than expectations.
